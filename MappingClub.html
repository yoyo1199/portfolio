<h1> Mapping Club</h1>
<p>At my school I co-founded a club called mapping club. i was introduced to mapping through my expirences with Peace Corps.</p>
<p>Mapping is an activity on the computer that helps developing countries. Mapping uses satalite images providedby Open Street Map and OSM Tasking Manager to help map out roads and building in developing countries without a full GPS data.</p>
<p>After students complete an area, Peace Corps sends volenteers there to bring aid and assistance. Peace corps voleenteers spend 1 to 2 years teaching local people new ways to survive.</p>
<p>Peace Corps volenteers sometimes build thing thats will help provide clean water, or they will teach them new ways of farming.</p>
<h3>Personal Aspects</h3>
<p>Mapping club particularly spoke to me because i am interested in computer science and coding.</p>
<p>I think its amazing that Peace corps found away for everyday people to participate in service that will effect people across the world</p>
